### Introduction
Genomic research data generated by researchers, including at *icipe*, has grown exponentially. This growth has increased the demand for bioinformatics skills for genomic data analysis, and the need to optimize the research output from the data. In addition, to ensure reproducible genomic research, there is a need for the adoption of open science practices in data storage, reproducible pipelines and collaborative research. The bioinformatics team plans to host a one-day workshop to train *icipe* researchers who work with genomic data on how they can plan a genomic project to ensure reproducibility. This training will set the foundation for other workshops the team has planned for the year.


### Instructors
